                As users engage with this website, they should practice identifying what the most important 
                resources are when looking for information and what less important resources are. For example, 
                a citation from the Interpreter Foundation is not going to have the same level of authority as 
                a citation from the Book of Mormon. Users should establish what the primary sources of information 
                are, and then work their way up the information tree to get the most encompassing view of the topic 
                they would like to have addressed. 

	            This website will attempt to lay out information in order of its level of authority. It may look 
                something like Scripture > words of the prophets > third party commentaries > etc.
