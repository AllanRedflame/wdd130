                Eternal Marriage
            </h1>

            <p class="marriage-paragraph-one">
                One of the unique characteristics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
                Saints is the high emphasis on Marriage and the family. Most world religions are very 
                family oriented, but in very few places can you find a church that locates marriage at the 
                climax of human spiritual development. Eternal marriage is the crowning ordinance in Latter-Day 
                Saint theology, opening the gateway for exaltation. 
                Interestingly, an individual’s spouse is the only other person aside from the Lord that we have been 
                commanded to love with all our hearts in the scriptures (D&C 42:22). Why is this? An Ensign articles 
                puts it simply, “Man has certain basic needs—moral, social, biological, and spiritual—and these can only 
                be fully realized in the God-ordained institution of eternal marriage.” The article goes on to say, 
                “The Latter-day Saint concept of eternal progression includes eternal development, eternal increase of 
                knowledge, power, intelligence, awareness, and all the characteristics and capacities that make for 
                Godhood. But in the economy of God man cannot attain this state of continuing perfection in his unfinished 
                or unmarried state. There must be growth and increase of the whole man; in other words, the man who has 
                found and been united to his other half.”
