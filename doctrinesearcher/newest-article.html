                        One of the unique characteristics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
                        Saints is the high emphasis on Marriage and the family. Most world religions 
                        are very family oriented, but in very few places can you find a church that 
                        locates marriage at the climax of human spiritual.
                        development. Eternal marriage is the crowning ordinance in Latter-Day Saint

                        theology, opening the gateway for 
                        exaltation. Interestingly, an 
                        individual’s spouse is the 
                        only other person aside from the 
                        Lord that we have been commanded to love 
                        with all our hearts in the scriptures 
                        (D&C 42:22). Why is this? An Ensign 
                        articles puts it 

                        simply, “Man has certain basic needs—moral, social, 
                        biological, and spiritual—and these can only be fully realized in the 
                        God-ordained institution of eternal marriage.” The article goes on to say, 
                        “The Latter-day Saint concept 
                    </p>

                        of eternal progression includes eternal 
                        development, eternal increase of knowledge, power, intelligence, awareness, 
                        and all the characteristics and capacities that make for Godhood. But in the 
                        economy of God man cannot attain this state of continuing perfection in his 
                        unfinished or unmarried state. There must be growth and increase of the whole man; 
                        in other words, the man who has found and been united to his other half.”
