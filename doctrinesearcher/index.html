                    In a day and age where so much information is being spread about the church and the beliefs of 
                    Latter-Day Saints, it is hard to know where to look when we have a question about a certain topic. 
                    We are taught to use divinely appointed resources when increasing our knowledge of the gospel, but 
                    what do we do when the answer to our question is not on the church’s website? That is the problem 
                    that I want to provide a solution to. I want to provide a directory of information and resources 
                    on a variety of searchable topics that people can use to answer their questions.<br>

                    As far as I am aware, there is nothing else out on the internet quite like what I am describing. 
                    ChurchofJesusChrist.org has an extensive catalog of answered questions, but they are primarily 
                    articles and are sometimes lacking in additional resources. Bookofmormoncentral.org has a lot 
                    of resources, but they may or may not have material for questions the average Latter-Day Saint 
                    might have.

                    Even some of the more versatile and general websites like the Interpreter Foundation 
                    can feel a little too rigorous and aren’t always very accessible if you do not have a lot of time 
                    to pour over the articles. What I want to do is bring together a great collection of commonly 
                    queried topics, a reliable library of trustworthy study materials, all while keeping everything 
                    user friendly and intuitive to understand. Some of the references this website will include are 
                    key scripture references, relevant conference talks, modern and historical statements by church 
                    leaders, gospel topics essays, YouTube videos, Maxwell Institute papers, books, commentaries, 
                    and other additional third-party documentation that may also be useful.
