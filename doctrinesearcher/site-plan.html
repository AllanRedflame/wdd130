        In a day and age where so much information is being spread about the church and the beliefs of 
        Latter-Day Saints, it is hard to know where to look when we have a question about a certain topic. 
        We are taught to use divinely appointed resources when increasing our knowledge of the gospel, but 
        what do we do when the answer to our question is not on the church’s website? That is the problem 
        that I want to provide a solution to. I want to provide a directory of information and resources 
        on a variety of searchable topics that people can use to answer their questions. 

        As far as I am aware, there is nothing else out on the internet quite like what I am describing. 
        ChurchofJesusChrist.org has an extensive catalog of answered questions, but they are primarily 
        articles and are sometimes lacking in additional resources. Bookofmormoncentral.org has a lot 
        of resources, but they may or may not have material for questions the average Latter-Day Saint 
        might have. Even some of the more versatile and general websites like the Interpreter Foundation 
        can feel a little too rigorous and aren’t always very accessible if you do not have a lot of time 
        to pour over the articles. What I want to do is bring together a great collection of commonly 
        queried topics, a reliable library of trustworthy study materials, all while keeping everything 
        user friendly and intuitive to understand. Some of the references this website will include are 
        key scripture references, relevant conference talks, modern and historical statements by church 
        leaders, gospel topics essays, YouTube videos, Maxwell Institute papers, books, commentaries, 
        and other additional third-party documentation that may also be useful.

      <h3>Website Guide</h3>
      <p>
        As users engage with this website, they should practice identifying what the most important 
        resources are when looking for information and what less important resources are. For example, 
        a citation from the Interpreter Foundation is not going to have the same level of authority as 
        a citation from the Book of Mormon. Users should establish what the primary sources of information 
        are, and then work their way up the information tree to get the most encompassing view of the topic 
        they would like to have addressed. 

	      This website will attempt to lay out information in order of its level of authority. It may look 
        something like Scripture > words of the prophets > third party commentaries > etc. 

        As the user explore Doctrine Searcher, they will operate the website’s navigation menu to find topics that they are interested in learning about. Here is an example of a question you could expect to have answered on this website. If you search the keywords baptism for the dead, your results might look something like this:
        Key scripture passages:
        D&C 128
        D&C 127
        1 Corinthians 15:29
        D&C 138
        Conference talks:
        The Redemption of the Dead and the Testimony of Jesus, D. Todd Christofferson, October 2000

      <h3>Newest Article: Eternal Marriage</h3>
      <p>
          
        One of the unique characteristics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is the high emphasis on Marriage and the family. Most world religions are very family oriented, but in very few places can you find a church that locates marriage at the climax of human spiritual development. Eternal marriage is the crowning ordinance in Latter-Day Saint theology, opening the gateway for exaltation. 
        Interestingly, an individual’s spouse is the only other person aside from the Lord that we have been commanded to love with all our hearts in the scriptures (D&C 42:22). Why is this? An Ensign articles puts it simply, “Man has certain basic needs—moral, social, biological, and spiritual—and these can only be fully realized in the God-ordained institution of eternal marriage.” The article goes on to say, “The Latter-day Saint concept of eternal progression includes eternal development, eternal increase of knowledge, power, intelligence, awareness, and all the characteristics and capacities that make for Godhood. But in the economy of God man cannot attain this state of continuing perfection in his unfinished or unmarried state. There must be growth and increase of the whole man; in other words, the man who has found and been united to his other half.”

        Key Scripture Passages:

        Genesis 2:18, 24
        D&C 132:19
        Matthew 19:6
        1 Corinthians 11:11
        Proverbs 18:22
